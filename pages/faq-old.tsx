      the athlete themselves. With only ten first edition cards (known as Inks) for each athlete, the sky is the limit for \
      the value of Inks minted by future stars and celebrities inside and outside of sports."

      first sale (4% on each subsequent sale). Athletes own a piece of their Ink forever, even if they sell it."

      the person that referred them, and one goes to our collective pool. You keep the other seven. Get more \
      Inks by referring up to five people using your referral code and having each of them refer five people."
