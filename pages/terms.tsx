When you buy an individual Ink from another user in the Marketplace, you will know the exact Ink that you are purchasing. We encourage you not to purchase Inks other than on the Marketplace. &nbsp;If you decide to purchase Inks in any other way, you understand that such purchases will be entirely at your sole risk. </span>

                                <span className="c1">(iv) Characteristics of Inks. Inks consist of a photograph of the athlete that created the original Ink, a video of the athlete, and a set of statistics that are associated with that athlete. &nbsp;Each Ink has a defined set of attributes which help determine the value of the Ink. </span>
                            </p>

                                <span className="c1">(v) Subjectivity of Inks. The value of each Ink is inherently subjective, in the same way the value of other collectibles is inherently subjective. Each Ink has no inherent or intrinsic value. Some collectors might prefer to have an Ink featuring a certain athlete from a particular high school, while another might prefer an Ink featuring a different athlete from that same high school. &nbsp;Each athlete can have more than one Ink associated with them, and those Inks will each have different characteristics (e.g. season and sport).</span>
